- Initial release (0.1) 30/07/2013.

  The initial release in coordination with the DARPA XDATA program. This release
  supports CUDA, OPEN MP, MIC, and TBB.  The list of implemented algorithms
  includes Breadth First Search (BFS), Connected Components (CC), PageRank (PR),
  Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP), and Betweenness Centrality (BC). For BC,
  the algorithm supports both exact and approximate BC.  Approximate BC is based
  on sampling. These algorithms have been implemented against the powergraph 
  Gather Apply Scatter (GAS) API.  Performance has not been optimized in this
  release.
